II. Core Concepts: 
    1. What is Mongoose ?
        - Mongoose: 
            +, similiar to sequelize, which helps 
                us to worry less about query and focus on working
                with data
            +, Mongoose is: ODM(Object Document Mapping) Library
            +, Sequelize is: ORM (Object Relational Mapping) Library
        
        - Example of using Mongoose: 
        https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OqeBKSM-bgMGF_rOtFq-MDCl8GejREmI/view?usp=sharing

            +, Allow us to work with models easily
                and query will be done behind the scene
    
    2. Core steps of using mongoose: 
        - Step 1: Define Models with schema. 
            NOTE: Even though mongodb (noSQL) is schemaless, 
                But the reason we define schema in our models is 
                to be able to work with data more and focus less 
                on the queries

        - Step 2: Create an instance of the model
        - Step 3: run mongoose queries with that instance
            created

    
III. Module Notes: 
    1. Connecting MongoDB Server with Mongoose: 
        - Code in 2nd Commit
        - app.js to see how to connect 

    2. Basic CRUD operations: 
        a. Creating Product Schema: 
            - Code in 3rd Commit
            - ./models/product.js: to see how to create a product 
                schema
        
        b. Fetching Data: 
            - Code in 3rd Commit
            - Fetching all products: 
                +, using find() > mongoose method to find all 
                +, ./controllers/shop.js: under getProducts(), 
                and getIndex()

            - Fetching a single product: 
                +, using findById(id)
                +, ./controllers/shop.js: under getProducts(), 
                and getIndex() 
        
        c. Updating Product: 
            - Code in 3rd Commit
            - Using save() method provided by Mongoose
            - ./models/admin.js under postEditProduct()
        
        d. Deleting Product: 
            - Code in 3rd Commit
            - Using findByIdAndRemove(id) provided by mongoose
            - ./models/admin.js under findByIdAndRemove()
    
    3. Relational operations in Mongoose: 
        a. Adding a new user: 
            - Code in 4th Commit
            - ./models/user.js: for user schema
            - app.js: for creating new user and passing user 
                to request
        
        b. Relation in Mongoose
            - Code in 6th Commit
            - In here, we're trying to have to product to have the user
                id so it indicates that the product belong to which user
            - ./controllers/admin.js: under postAddProduct() to see 
                how a product is created with user id

            - ./models/product.js: There is a 'userId' field with 'ref: "User"'
                > this indicate that the userId refer to id of 
                some user In users collection
            - Same thing if you look into the cart of ./models/user.js

            NOTE: how to target and populate related data only
                > see video 219, we don't implement it here

    4. Other operations: 

        a. Adding to Cart, Fetching from Cart and working with populate(): 
            - Code in 8th Commit
            - Adding to Cart: 
                +, ./models/user.js: to see how addToCart() function 
                    is handled
                +, ./controllers/shop.js: under postCart() to see how  
                    to add to cart
            - Fetching products from cart and working with populate(): 
                +, ./controllers/shop.js: under getCart() to see how 
                    to fetch products from cart and how to work with  
                    populate()
        
        b. Removing items from cart: 
            - Code in 9th Commit, will show creating an order, contains
                both creating order and removing items
            - ./models/user.js: find removeFromCart() to see how we 
                operate this operation
            - ./controllers/shop.js: under postCartDeleteProduct()
                to see how we do that 

        c. Create an Orders:
